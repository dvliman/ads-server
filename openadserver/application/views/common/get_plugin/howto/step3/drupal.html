<p>Sometimes it is necessity to change settings of the module. Such situation can arise, for instance if: the address of ad server was changed, you have changed api key etc. To avoid reinstallation of the module each time you have made the settings interface.</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Go to”Site Configuration → <%SITE_NAME%> Ads”. At the top select “Settings”.</li>
   <li>In the opened interface you can inout new appikey, address of ad server or website id.</li>
   <li>Save the changes.</li>
   <li>Refresh the page.</li>
   </ol>
<p>In case you have entered wrong setting you will see a notification message with a code and error description. You won’t be able to add new channels until the error in the settings will be removed.</p>
