<p>Sometimes it is necessity to change settings of the plug-in. Such situation can be arised, for instance if: the address of ad server was changed, you have changed api key etc. To avoid reinstallation of the plug-in each time you have made the settings interface.
   <ol>
   <li>Go to “Plugins → <%SITE_NAME%> Config”.</li>
   <li>In the opened interface you can inout new apikey, address of ad server or website id.</li>
   <li>Save the changes.</li>
   <li>Refresh the page.</li>
   </ol>
In case you have entered wrong setting you will see a notification message with a code and error description. You won’t be able to add new channels until the error in the settings will be removed.
