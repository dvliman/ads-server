Upgrading from Max or phpAdsNew
===============================

This upgrade document is a first version - there may very well be issues with the process
described below. Please, make sure that you backup your Max or phpAdsNew data, and ensure
that you can restore from the backup if something goes wrong.  If something does go wrong,
please contact us on the mailing list (http://max.awarez.net/) and we'll do our best to
help you out!

Please note that while you can upgrade from ANY version of Max, you can only upgrade from
phpAdsNew 2.0 or greater. If you are running a version of phpAdsNew earlier than 2.0, please
download phpAdsNew 2.0, and follow the instructions included in phpAdsNew to upgrade your
installation. Once done, you can then upgrade from phpAdsNew 2.0 to Max. (Please also note
that you cannot upgrade from phpPgAds.)


To upgrade:

1)  BACKUP YOUR DATA!

2)  If you are upgrading from Max, disable your maintenance script cronjob/schtask.

3)  Shut down your webserver.

4)  Move your old Max or phpAdsNew installation folder to a backup location. (For example,
    if Max was installed in /var/www/html/max, move that folder to something like
    /var/www/html/max-backup.)
    
5)  If you are upgrading from Max, also move your maintenance directory to a backup
    location. (For example, if you Max maintenance directory was /usr/local/maintenance,
    move that folder to something like /usr/local/maintenance-backup.)

6)  Unzip the new version of Max, put the files in the same location that your old Max or 
    phpAdsNew installation used to be. (For example, if Max used to be installed in
    /var/www/html/max before you moved it in Step 2, then install the new version of Max
    in the same location, /var/www/html/max.)
    
7)  Move the maintenance directory in the new version of Max out of the web server
    directory. If you are upgrading from Max, then put it in the same location as the old
    maintenance directory. If you are upgrading from phpAdsNew, you will not have an old
    maintenance directory - please consult the "Maintenance" section in the INSTALL.txt
    file for details on how to set up maintenance scripts in Max.
    
8)  If you are running Max on a unix-like operating system (not Windows) you may need to
    give the web server write access to the config.inc.php file. This file can be found
    in the top Max directory. Set write access with the command (as root):
   
      chmod a+w config.inc.php
     
9)  If you are running Max on Windows, right click on the config.inc.php file in Windows
    Explorer, select "Properties" and ensure that the file is not marked as "Read-only".
    
10) Restart your web server.    

11) Using your web browser, go to the web page that you normally use to manage Max or
    phpAdsNew. You should be presented with the Max automated install program. Use the 
    program to "install" Max, and the process will take care of upgrading your existing
    installation.
    
    /**********************************************************************************/
    IMPORTANT: When specifying you database connection, you must enter the database
    hostname, port number, username, password, and database name of your EXISTING
    Max or phpAdsNew installation. You must ALSO specify the SAME table name prefix
    and table type as you specified when you installed Max or phpAdsNew.
    
    NOTE: The default table type for phpAdsNew is MyISAM, while Max has a default table
    type of InnoDB. Max is able to run using MyISAM tables, so if you are upgrading from
    phpAdsNew, please select your original table type. However, if you want to obtain
    the speed benefits of using InnoDB tables, please read the information at:
      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Converting_tables_to_InnoDB.html
    Don't forget to change your config.inc.php file's $phpAds_config['table_type']
    to "INNODB" afterwards!
    
    NOTE: Depending on the version of Max or phpAdsNew you are upgrading from, the 
    process may take a while. Please be patient!
    /**********************************************************************************/
    
12) Once the automated install program has finished, your installation will now be upgraded.

13) After the upgrade is complete, you will be asked to log in using you existing admin
    username and password. You will then be taken to the Max "Settings" screen. Once you
    have made any changes you want, please remember to lock the config.inc.php file, so
    that changes cannot be accidentally or maliciously made. If you are running a unix-like
    operating system, remove write access with the command (as root):
    
      chmod a-w config.inc.php
      
    If you are running Max on Windows, right click on the config.inc.php file in 
    Windows Explorer, select "Properties" and ensure that the file IS marked as
    "Read-only".
    
14) If your old Max or phpAdsNew installation used banners of "Local banner (Webserver)"
    type, these banners will have been stored in your old installation's images directory.
    You will need to copy these banners from the backup copy of your installation (that
    you made in step 4) into the images directory of you new Max installation.

15) If you are upgrading from Max, you will need to re-edit your maintenance config file
    found in your Max maintenance directory, before you re-enable your maintenance script
    cronjob/schtask.
    
16) If you are upgrading from phpAdsNew, please consult the "Maintenance" section in the
    INSTALL.txt file for details on how to set up maintenance scripts in Max, if you have
    not already done so.
    
17) Enjoy!
