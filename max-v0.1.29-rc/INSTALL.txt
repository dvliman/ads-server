Requirements
============

Any operating system/web server that supports MySQL and PHP
PHP (version 4.3.6 or later, including PHP5)
MySQL (version 4.0.12 or later)



Installation
============

1)  Using the MySQL client, create a new database for Max (eg. "CREATE DATABASE max;").

2)  Create a new MySQL user with access to the database you created above, for Max to
    use to access the database. Consult the MySQL documentation on how to do this.

3)  Configure your web server to answer requests for your domain name, for example,
    "http://example.com/". Your web server documentation will tell you how to do this.

4)  Download the Max Media Manager file from http://max.awarez.net/.

5)  Extract the Max zip file. 

6)  Put the files into an appropriate directory in your web server root. For example,
    if your web server's root is "/var/www/html/" you may choose to put the Max files
    in "/var/www/html/MaxMediaManager". In this way, you will be able to access the
    Max interface by using a web browser to access "http://example.com/MaxMediaManager/".

7)  If you are running Max on a unix-like operating system (not Windows) you may need
    to give the web server write access to the config.inc.php file. This file can be
    found in the top Max directory. Set write access with the command (as root):
   
      chmod a+w config.inc.php
     
8)  If you are running Max on Windows, right click on the config.inc.php file in 
    Windows Explorer, select "Properties" and ensure that the file is NOT marked as
    "Read-only".

9)  Using your web browser, go to "http://example.com/MaxMediaManager/" (using your
    domain name and installation directory) and you will be guided through an automated
    install.
   
10)  After the installation is complete, you will be asked to log in using the admin
    username and password you set up during the installation. You will then be taken
    to the Max "Settings" screen. Once you have made any changes you want, please
    remember to lock the config.inc.php file, so that changes cannot be accidentally
    or maliciously made. If you are running a unix-like operating system, remove
    write access with the command (as root):
    
      chmod a-w config.inc.php
      
    If you are running Max on Windows, right click on the config.inc.php file in 
    Windows Explorer, select "Properties" and ensure that the file IS marked as
    "Read-only".

11) Enjoy!



Maintenance
===========

With Max Media Manager it is necessary to set up a cronjob on the webserver
to run the maintenance scripts.

 -  Firstly, move the maintenance folder out of the current directory layout,
    so that it is not possible for someone to run the maintenance scripts
    via a web browser (this could bring your adserver to a screaming halt).
    The directory you move the maintenance folder to will be referred to as
    <max_maintenance_dir> for the remainder of this file.
    
 -  Then, edit the maintenance config file found at 
    <max_maintenance_dir>/default.conf.ini. You should normally only need to
    edit the database details (including the database table names, if necessary),
    unless you want to do something fancy.
    
 -  Under Unix-like systems, create a cronjob similar to the following (you may
    need to change the location of php from "/usr/local/bin/php" to match your
    setup) which will run the maintenance scripts once an hour, every hour, on
    the hour:
    
    0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php -q <max_maintenance_dir>/maintenance.php
    
 -  Under Windows systems, schedule the maintenance script using "schtasks" 
    by running a command similar to the following at the Command Prompt (you
    may need to change the location of php from "c:\php\php-win.exe" to match
    your setup) which will run the maintenance scripts once an hour, every
    hour, on the hour:
    
    schtasks /create /sc hourly /st 00:00:00 /tn "Max Maintenance" 
        /tr "c:\php\php-win.exe \"<max_maintenance_dir>\maintenance.php\""
    
    Note: The above command needs to be on one line.
        
    Note: You may need to re-install PHP with the CLI option if the php-win.exe
    file does not exist.
    
    Note: More information on setting up scheduled tasks in Windows can be
    found at:
